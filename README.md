massive_heat
============

An excercise in solving the heat equation in three dimentions using MPI

* Expand heat equation using [Finite
  Difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference):
  * Fixed Boundary Conditions
  * Central difference for interior points
* Solve using Runge-Kutta
  * Eventually use HyperExtended Backward Differentiation Formula
